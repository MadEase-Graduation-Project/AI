# Symptom-Based Disease Prediction Chatbot - Project Summary

## 🎯 **Project Overview**
This project implements a medical chatbot that predicts diseases based on patient symptoms using machine learning. The system provides disease predictions, severity assessment, and recommendations. The latest version focuses on robust user experience, medical safety, and readiness for team collaboration and future integration.

**🆕 Phase 3 Complete**: Enhanced with data-driven prediction explanations, intelligent follow-up questions, and comprehensive medical safety features.

## 🚨 **Critical Issues Identified & Resolved**

### 1. **Data Leakage Problem** ✅ **FIXED**
- **Issue**: Test dataset contained exact duplicates of training data
- **Impact**: 100% accuracy was artificial and unreliable
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed duplicate symptom combinations
  - Implemented proper train/validation/test splits
  - Added data leakage detection

### 2. **Limited Data Diversity** ✅ **IMPROVED**
- **Issue**: Only 5-7 unique symptom combinations per disease
- **Impact**: Poor model generalization
- **Solution**: 
  - Implemented rule-based data augmentation
  - Generated 20 new plausible combinations per disease
  - Increased diversity from 5-7 to 5-16 combinations per disease

### 3. **Inadequate Model Evaluation** ✅ **ENHANCED**
- **Issue**: No proper cross-validation or hyperparameter tuning
- **Impact**: Unreliable performance estimates
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented 3-fold cross-validation
  - Added GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization
  - Created comprehensive evaluation framework

### 4. **AI-Augmented Data Safety Issues** ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Issue**: AI-augmented data contained medically implausible symptom combinations
- **Impact**: Unsafe predictions and incorrect medical associations
- **Solution**:
  - Removed unsafe AI-augmented data
  - Implemented safe, rule-based data augmentation
  - Created medically validated dataset (1,695 samples)
  - Maintained strict medical plausibility

## 🤖 **Chatbot Logic & User Experience (2024 Update)**

- **Fuzzy/Typo Matching**: Uses difflib to auto-correct clear typos and suggest corrections for ambiguous symptom input.
- **Generic Term Handling**: If a user enters a generic term (e.g., "pain", "fever"), the chatbot prompts for clarification and lets the user select specific symptoms.
- **Symptom Review/Edit**: Before diagnosis, users can review, add, or remove symptoms to ensure accuracy.
- **Rule-Based Post-Processing**: If all symptoms are mild/common and the top prediction is severe with low confidence, the bot suggests a mild disease instead.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for clarity, error handling, and easy interaction. All user input is robustly handled.
- **Team Readiness**: Modular, well-documented codebase, with clear onboarding and configuration instructions.
- **Input Normalization & Prompt Consistency**: All yes/no prompts now accept both 'yes/y' and 'no/n' in all chatbot flows and modes, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience.

**🆕 Phase 3 Enhancements:**

- **📊 Data-Driven Prediction Explanations**: The chatbot now explains its predictions by showing which symptoms contributed most to the diagnosis, using feature importance analysis.
- **🎯 Top-3 Display for Low Confidence**: When confidence is low, the chatbot shows the top 3 possible diseases with confidence scores and encourages users to add more symptoms.
- **🔍 Intelligent Follow-up Questions**: Data-driven follow-up questions based on missing critical symptoms, not hardcoded rules.
- **🏥 Doctor Recommendations**: Integration with medical API to recommend relevant specialists based on predicted disease.
- **🛡️ Enhanced Medical Safety**: Comprehensive medical validation, severity scoring, and safety warnings for all predictions.
