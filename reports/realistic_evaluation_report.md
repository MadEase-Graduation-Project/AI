# Realistic Model Evaluation Report

## Executive Summary
The model was evaluated using multiple realistic testing scenarios to assess true generalization performance.

## Key Findings

### Performance Metrics
- **Original Test Accuracy**: 1.0000 (potentially overfitting)
- **3-Fold Cross-Validation**: 0.9925 ± 0.0035
- **5-Fold Stratified CV**: 0.9917
- **Noise Robustness**: 0.6443 (with 10% noise)

### Interpretation

✅ **MODEL SHOWS GOOD GENERALIZATION**
- Cross-validation accuracy is high and consistent
- Model should perform well on new data


### Recommendations
1. **Cross-Validation**: Use 0.993 as the true performance metric
2. **Noise Testing**: Model robustness to noise is 0.644
3. **Real-world Validation**: Test with external datasets
4. **Data Collection**: Gather more diverse symptom combinations

### Conclusion
The 100% test accuracy is likely due to overfitting to a small, artificial test set. 
The cross-validation accuracy of 0.993 is a more realistic 
estimate of true model performance.
